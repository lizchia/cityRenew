    <h1>Time to Revive! Zhongxing New Village</h1>
    <p>This policy aims at developing a better strategy to make Zhongxing New Village, located at Nantou County, the central part of Taiwan, a wonderful cultural and educational settlement. In this paper, we summarize the projects and researches that are related to the planning of Zhongxing New Village, and focus on the concept of local uniqueness. In this way, we predict to form a practical way to preserve and revive the village.
        The current policy that deals with the development of Zhongxing New Village is “i-Taiwan 12 Projects-Industrial Innovation Corridors,” proposed by Council for Economic Planning and Development, Executive Yuan in 2008. The policy empowers the central government to develop Zhongxing New Village, which was the purview of Nantou County government, and it replaces “Zhongxing Residence Artist Program” with “The 5th Central Taiwan Science Park Program”.
        Though the current policy aims at economic planning and technical industry development, it’s overlooked the unique village heritage and a series of constructional plans that have focused on the cultural value of the village since 1996. Moreover, the potential of the village to conduct cultural, educational activities and creative industry are overlooked. The policy lacks prospects and innovation. Still, it failed to realize its goals, such as stimulates the economic growth of the village.
        In this paper, what we propose are in the following orders:
        Firstly, we discuss about the history of Zhongxing New Village and its predicament and causes. Secondly, we introduce into “Advanced Research Park Program” and its drawback, contradiction, and the potential problems. Thus, we do convince the reasons what we strongly support to be our foot stone ,“All Regions of Zhongxing New Village supposes to be Preserved as Significant Settlements,” a never before seen way of cultural heritage preservation in Taiwan. Thirdly, we discuss about the revitalization and management of “Public Functionary Settlement” which is the beginning step of our policy─revitalize the vacant spaces. We advise that under the current organizational change of Taiwan Central Government, the newly established “Ministry of Culture” should take the serious responsibility to preserve cultural heritage, and also revive Zhongxing New Village, which is currently under the control of Central Taiwan Science Park Administration, National Science Council. Our intermediate target is the formation of “Central Taiwan Administrative centre”. In short, we advise that some departments of the central government, such as Ministry of Culture, move to Zhongxing New Village since its historical and geographical superiority, the central part of Taiwan, make it an excellent spot for cultural activities. Lastly, our final step is to form the uniqueness of the village, that is, to design and conduct “Cultural Education” for local schools and form an “Eco-Museum” for people. “Culture and Creativity” is our central idea. We plan to promote Zhongxing New Village with its uniqueness of nature, architecture, history, and people.
        The concepts of the policy will be shown into 2 diagrams─“Venn Diagram with the Spatial Arrangement of Zhongxing New Village” and “Pyramid Diagram with Three-Step-Revitalization-Process of Zhongxing New Village”.
